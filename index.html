        <p>Leonardo’s parents were not married. His father, Ser Piero, was a wealthy Florentine lawyer and his mother, Caterina, was a young peasant girl. He spent his early years with his mother but then lived in the household of his father, grandparents and uncle. His father went on to marry four times! Da Vinci was a huge animal lover. He even chose to be a vegetarian, something that was very unusual in those days. He was said to buy animals from the market just so he could set them free from their cages!<br><br>Leonardo was left handed. But as well as using his left hand to write, he wrote back to front, from right to left across the page which meant that, for many years, people were unable to understand his notes. This kind of ‘mirror writing’ led people to believe that Da Vinci wanted to keep his ideas secret! Leonardo obviously had an amazing mind but believe it or not he never went to school! Instead he was taught reading, writing and maths at home. </p>
